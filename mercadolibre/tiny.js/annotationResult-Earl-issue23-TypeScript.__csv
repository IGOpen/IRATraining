mercadolibre/tiny.js,23,0c48b70a8f0abeb565335724d8effb2df8c61ca9,TypeScript,Undetectable,This fix has a type component to it in the checks on the parameter e1.  When e1 is null or undefined, this fix returns an empty array.  This seems like a strange choice; intuitively, it would seem better to disallow null/undefined parameters, rather than silently returning an empty array.  Regardless of whether the application logic would allow annotating this function to require a defined/nonnull parameter, TypeScript does not support such an annotation.,180.0
