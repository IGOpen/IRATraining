expressjs/serve-static,3,a1972ecd7055b39489d1aff8127e50b3966a5b6f,TypeScript,Undetectable,This a logic problem used to select an initialization value.,65.0
expressjs/serve-static,3,a1972ecd7055b39489d1aff8127e50b3966a5b6f,TypeScript,Undetectable,Flow can detect this and TypeScript cannot, if we assume that we cannot change library code.  This is because Flow's inference flows into 3rd libraries, while TypeScript's does not.  If we could change node's url module, we could add a typeof === 'undefined' check which would error.  Note that this check would be at runtime, not compile time.  It is natural, however, to consider this code to be a type annotation and its check to be type checking.,18.0
